                -> Page segmentation modes:(--psm)
                0    Orientation and script detection (OSD) only.
                1    Automatic page segmentation with OSD.
                2    Automatic page segmentation, but no OSD, or OCR. (not implemented)
                3    Fully automatic page segmentation, but no OSD. (Default)
                4    Assume a single column of text of variable sizes.
                5    Assume a single uniform block of vertically aligned text.
                6    Assume a single uniform block of text.
                7    Treat the image as a single text line.
                8    Treat the image as a single word.
                9    Treat the image as a single word in a circle.
                10    Treat the image as a single character.
                11    Sparse text. Find as much text as possible in no particular order.
                12    Sparse text with OSD.
                13    Raw line. Treat the image as a single text line,
                bypassing hacks that are Tesseract-specific.

                -> OCR Engine modes: (see https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki#linux) (--oem)
                0    Legacy engine only.
                1    Neural nets LSTM engine only.
                2    Legacy + LSTM engines.
                3    Default, based on what is available.
